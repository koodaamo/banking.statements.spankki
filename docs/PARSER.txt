Parser notes
===============

This document contains some notes on how the parser works and why it is so.


S-Pankki PDF structure
-----------------------

Here's a quick overview of the characteristics of the structure that are most relevant to
parsing the PDF:

- the PDFs are made of three main parts; top and bottom that contain various metadata, and
  the list of transactions

- visually, the list of transactions takes a form of a table, however it is missing any
  kind of explicit row indicators (lines)

- the text elements can be grouped, but not always so

- the text elements may contain many logical parts, separated by a whitespace or a newline


How PDFMiner works
-------------------

PDFMiner provides a list of elements found on each page. Each element has type and
coordinate information. Elements may also be grouped, so the element structure constitutes
a hierarchy. However given the flexibility of how PDFs can be constructed, this structure
is completely application-dependent and thus varies wildly.

Table augmentation
------------------

Given that the S-Pankki PDFs have no row lines. We need some other means of identifying
rows and their limits. For this, we use the transaction counters that start from 1 for
each statement, and that can be found in column four. For this purpose, there are
utilities for:

- generating (left, right) pairs of column edge coordinates
- extracting the fourth column tx counters

Table specification
--------------------

There are some utility functions to determine for example the coordinates of the
transaction table, column borders and so on.

Text element extraction
------------------------

The PDFMiner element output can have many different kinds of text elements, some of which
are actually containers. For this reason, an utility is provided that walks down through
all the text elements so each logical text element (and its coordinates) can be accessed.
